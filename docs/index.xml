      <description>I had thought to wait until the 4th of July to write something seasonal about the dangers of loud noise to our hearing. But then it occurred to me that fireworks are only one of many decibel-defying culprits in our summer seduction with sound. Indeed, with the onset of warm weather, we in northeast Ohio, along with nearly everyone else in America, tend to welcome the noises we have come to associate with spring and summer.</description>

      <description>We’ve all heard about the silent killers—health hazards such as stress and hypertension that can wield their dangerous effects by sneaking up on us, without our realizing it. But scientists are also finding that a lifetime of everyday noise levels can be just as dangerous, not just to our hearing health, but to our stress levels, sleeping ability, and cardiovascular health.
