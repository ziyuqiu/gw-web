      <description>Recently, a person with tinnitus asked me &amp;ldquo;Does caffeine affect tinnitus?&amp;rdquo; Over the years, he&amp;rsquo;d received both yes and no answers from ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctors.
Through my research, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple yes-or-no answer to this question.
Tinnitus is a condition in which a person perceives a sound such as ringing, roaring, whooshing, or clicking in one or both ears. The perceived sound can range from acute to chronic, and from annoying to debilitating.</description>

      <description>If I were to ask you what the number one occupational and environmental hazard is, what would you say?
Would you believe it&amp;rsquo;s noise? It&amp;rsquo;s true. Hearing loss caused by excessive exposure to loud noise - called noise-induced hearing loss, or NIHL - is one of the most common causes of sensorineural hearing loss, second only to hearing loss caused by aging. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve a drug that can prevent hearing loss from either of these sources or any other source, for that matter.</description>
