description : Over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from hearing disorders, including hearing loss due to aging or noise exposure (NIHL or ARHL). In the U.S. alone, hearing disorders affect 38 million Americans, and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the number one occupational and recreational hazard identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the market for hearing loss prevention or treatment of hearing loss.
description2 : With a decade of translational research funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH), Gateway Biotechnology has been developing drug candidates with proven safety records to combat hearing disorders. Our innovative approach, grounded in a deep understanding of basic mechanisms underlying hearing loss, targets multiple cellular pathways with new product formulations that fine-tune drug delivery to the ear.
