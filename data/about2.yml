description : Over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from hearing disorders, including hearing loss due to aging (Age-related Hearing Loss, ARHL) or noise exposure (Noise-Induced Hearing Loss, NIHL). In the U.S. alone, hearing disorders affect 36 million Americans.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimates that each year over 22 million workers are exposed to damaging levels of noise and hearing loss is the most common work-related illness in the U.S. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the market for hearing loss prevention or treatment of hearing loss.
description2 : With a decade of product development funded by initial investment from co-founders, and subsequently awards from National Institutes of Health (NIH), Gateway Biotechnology has been developing drug candidates with proven safety records to combat hearing disorders. Our innovative approach, grounded in a deep understanding of basic mechanisms underlying hearing loss, targets multiple cellular pathways with new product formulations that fine-tune drug delivery to the ear.
